Abstract
--------

SiiS is a trading bot for forex, indices and cryptocurrencies markets.
It also supports semi-automated trading in way to manage your entries and exits
with more possibilities than exchanges allows.

It is developed in Python3, using TA-lib, numpy and twisted/autobahn.
Uses a PostgreSQL database. Can support MySQL (not officially tested).

I have no commercials interests with trading platforms.

Current supported version
-------------------------

The current supported version is 0.3.7 or greater, and release 467 or above.
Older versions are no longer supported. Any forks are not supported.

Thanks to check that you use only the official repository : [https://github.com/firebird631/siis](https://github.com/firebird631/siis).

Installation
------------

Need Python 3.8 or a more recent version. Tested on Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora.

First you have to fetch this repository or to download a recent release. 

### Create the PIP virtual env ###

From siis base directory :

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You need to activate it each time you open your terminal before running SiiS.

From deps/ directory, first install TA-Lib (a C lib needed by the Python binding) :

```
tar xvzf deps/ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
cd ta-lib
cp ../deps/patch/ta_utility.h src/ta_func
./configure
make
```

This includes a patch necessary to get correct Bollinger-Bands values for market price very low (<0.0001) else all the values will be the sames.

Eventually you need to have to install the build-essential packages from your distribution repository in way to have GCC, Make and Autotools.
On Debian you can do : _apt-get install build-essential_.

Finally, to install in your /usr/local :

```
sudo make install
```

Or eventually if you have installed TA-lib in a custom prefix (e.g., with ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX),
then you have to specify 2 variables before installing the requirements :

```
export TA_LIBRARY_PATH=$PREFIX/lib
export TA_INCLUDE_PATH=$PREFIX/include
```

For more details on TA-lib installation please visit : https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib

### Python dependencies ###

From siis base directory :

```
pip install -r deps/requirements.txt
```

Then depending on which database storage to use :

```
pip install -r deps/reqspgsql.txt  # if using PostgreSQL (recommended)
pip install -r deps/reqsmysql.txt  # or if using MySQL
```

You might need to install the C client library before. Please refer to psycopg2 or MySQLdb Python package documentation.
On Debian based for PostgreSQL you will need to install libpq-dev by doing : _apt-get install libpq-dev_.

Before running the lib folder containing TA-Lib must be found in the _LD_LIBRARY_PATH_ :

Doing, if installed in the default directory _/usr/local/lib_ :

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

### Database ###

Prefers the PostgreSQL database server for performance and because I have mostly tested with it.
Another argument in favor of PostreSQL is in a future I could use of the extension TimescaleDB to improve timeseries tables performances.

The _sql/_ directory contains the initial SQL script for creations of the tables.
The first line of comment in these files describe a possible way to install them.

#### PostgreSQL ####

##### TimescaleDB #####

The next step is not required at this time.

###### Debian or Ubuntu ######

In root (or sudo) :

```
sh -c "echo 'deb https://packagecloud.io/timescale/timescaledb/debian/ `lsb_release -c -s` main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/timescaledb.list"
wget --quiet -O - https://packagecloud.io/timescale/timescaledb/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install timescaledb-postgresql-11
```

You could have to replace `lsb_release -c -s` by buster ou bulleye if you are on a Debian sid.

##### Database creation #####

```
su - postgres
```

If you are using TCP socket connection do :

```
psql -h localhost -U root -W -p 5432
```

If you are using a local unix socket :

```
psql -U root -W
```

Then in the psql CLI (you can define another username or password) :

```
CREATE DATABASE siis;
CREATE USER siis WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'siis';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE siis TO siis;
```

For the future usage of TimescaleDB (this step is not required for now)

```
CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb;
```

Now exit (CTRL-C) the psql CLI.

You can run the table creation script :

Using TCP socket connection do :

```
psql -h localhost -d siis -U siis -W -p 5432 -a -q -f sql/initpg.sql
```

Or using local unix socket :

```
psql -d siis -U siis -W -a -q -f sql/initpg.sql
```

Configuration
-------------

The first running create a data structure on your local user.
* **/home/\<username\>/.siis** on Linux based systems
* **C:\Users\\<username\>\AppData\Local\siis** on Windows
* **/Users/\<username\>/.siis** on MacOSX

The directory will contain 4 subdirectories:

* **config/** contains important configurations files (described belows)
  * [Explanations of the different configuration files](/doc/configuration/index.md)
* **log/** contains the log files
  * [Explanations of the different log files](/doc/logging.md)
* **markets/** contains the market data with subdirectories for each exchange
  * [Explanations of the markets data](/doc/organisation/dataset.md)
* **reports/** contains the reports of the strategies traders, and used by default for scripts executions results
  * Some strategy have the capacity to log trades, signals, performance and even more.
  * Some user script write files to disk by using this directory as default

Running
-------

```
python siis.py <identity> [--help, --options...]
```

The identity name must be specified, and need to be configured into the _identities.json_ file.

### List of command line options ###

You need to define the name of the identity to use. This is related to the name defined into the identity.json file.
Excepted for most of the tools, the name of the profile to use **--profile=\<profile-name\>** must be specified.

There are different running mode, the normal mode, will start the watchers, the trading capacity (paper-mode, live or backtesting) 
and offers an interactive terminal session, or you can run the specifics tools (fetcher, binarizer, optimizer, syncer, rebuilder...).

[More information about the different tools.](doc/tools)

Fetcher : importing some historical market data
-----------------------------------------------

Fetching is the process of getting historical market data (details, OHLCs, trades/ticks).
OHLCs data goes into the SQL database, trades/ticks data goes into the filesystem, organized into the _markets/_ directory.

Starting with an example will be more intuitive :

```
python siis.py real --tool=fetcher --broker=binance.com --market=*USDT,*BTC --from=2017-08-01T00:00:00 --to=2019-08-31T23:59:59 --timeframe=1w
```

This example will fetch any weekly OHLCs for the markets pairs based on USDT and BTC, from 2017-08-01 to 2019-08-31.
Common timeframes are formed of a number plus a letter (s for second, m for minute, h for hour, d for day, w for week, M for month).
Here we want only the weekly OHLC, then **--timeframe=1w**.

Defines the range of datetime using **--from=\<datetime\>** and **--to=\<datetime\>**.
The format of the datetime is 4 digits year, 2 digits month, 2 digits day of month, a T separator (meaning time),
2 digits hour, 2 digits minutes, 2 digits seconds. The datetime is interpreted as UTC. It could be simplified by omitting some parts.
You can omit seconds, minutes, hours, only specify the date part, a date without the day of month, 
a date with only the year will start on first of january. 

The optional option --cascaded=\<max-timeframe> will generate the higher multiple of OHLC until one of (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d, 1w, 1M).
The non-multiple timeframe (like 3m, or 45m) are not generated with cascaded because of the nature of the implementation in cascade it is not possible.
You have to use the rebuild command option to generate these OHLC from a sub-multiple.

For example, this will fetch from 5m OHLC from exchange, and then generate 15m, 30m, 1h, 2h, 4h and 1d from them :

```
python siis.py real --fetch --broker=binance.com --market=BTCUSDT --from=2017-08 --to=2019-08-31T23:59:59 --timeframe=5m --cascaded=1d
```

Market must be the unique market id of the broker, not the common usual name. The comma act as a separator. 
A wildcard * can be placed at the beginning of the market identifier. A negation symbol ! can be placed at the beginning 
of the market identifier to exclude a specific market when a wildcard filter is also used.
Example of **--market=\*USDT,!BCHUSDT** will fetch for any USDT based except for BCHUSDT.

If you need to only fetch the last n recent OHLCs, you can use the **--last=\<number\>** option.

The **--spec** optional option could be necessary with some fetchers, like with alphavantage.co where you have to 
specify the type of the market (--spec=STOCK).

Getting trade/tick level data imply to define **--timeframe=t**. 

```
python siis.py real --fetch --broker=binance.com --market=BTCUSDT --from=2017-08 --to=2019-08-31T23:59:59 --timeframe=t
```

You can set the --cascaded option even from tick/trade timeframe.
For example a complete fetching from 1m to 1w :

```
python siis.py real --fetch --broker=binance.com --market=BTCUSDT --from=2017-08 --to=2019-08-31T23:59:59 --timeframe=t --cascaded=1w
```

In the _scripts/_ directory there is some examples of how you can fetch your data using a bash script. 
These scripts could be installed in a crontab.

Take care than some exchanges have limitations. For example IG will limit to 10 000 candles per week. 
This limit is quickly reached. 
Some others, like BitMex limit to 30 queries per second in non auth mode or 60 in auth mode. That mean get months of 
data of trades could take more than a day.

[More information about the fetching process and the different fetchers.](doc/fetchers/index.md)

Backtesting
-----------

Let's start with an example :

```
python siis.py real --profile=my-backtest1 --backtest --from=2017-08 --to=2017-12-31T23:59:59 --timestep=15
```

Backtesting, like live and paper-mode need to know which profile to use. Let's define a profile file named 
_my-backtest1.json_ in our _.siis/config/profiles/_.

The datetime range must be defined, **--from=** and **--to=**, and a **--timestep==** must be specified.
This will be the minimal increment of time - in second - between two iterations.
The lesser the timestep is the longer the computation will take, but if you have a strategy that 
works at the tick/trade level then the backtesting will be more accurate.

A C++ version have no performance issue (can run 1000x faster than the Python version).

Imagine your strategy works on close of 4h OHLC, you can run your backtesting with a --timestep=4h. 
Else imagine your strategy works on close of 5m, but you want the exit of a trade be more reactive than 5m, 
because if the price move briefly in few seconds, then you'll probably have different results using a lesser timestep.

Ideally a timestep of 0.1 second will give accurate results, but the computations could take many hours, depending on
what your strategy compute internally. 
Some optimizations to only recompute the only last value for indicators will probably give a bit a performance, 
but the main problem rest the nature of the Python.  Without optimized C or C++ submodules I have no idea how to 
optimize it : GIL is slow, Python list and slicing are slow, even a simple loop take a lot of time compared to C/C++.

Originally I've developed this backtesting feature to be focused to replay multiples markets, on a virtual account, 
not only oriented to backtest the raw performance of the strategy.

Adding the **--time-factor=\<factor\>** will add a supplementary delay during each iteration of the backtesting. 
The idea is if you want to replay a recent period, and have the time to interact manually, like replaying a 
semi-automated day of scalping. The factor is a multiple of the time : 1 meaning real-time, then 60 mean 1 minute of 
simulation per second.

[More information about backtesting and its advanced usage.](doc/backtesting/index.md)

How to create or modify an existing strategy
--------------------------------------------

[A guide explaining how to create, modify and configure a strategy.](doc/strategies/index.md)

The winning strategy
--------------------

Understand the given strategies acts here as examples, you can use them, can work on some patterns, 
cannot work on some others. Considers doing your owns, or to use SiiS as a trading monitor with improved trade following,
dynamic stop-loss, take-profit. Some fixes could be needed for the current strategies, it serves as a labs.

I will publish some other of my strategies into distinct repositories.

Paper-mode
----------

Trading with live data but on a virtual local simulated trading account.

Example :

```
python siis.py real --profile=bitmex-xbteth1 --paper-mode
```

Here **real** mean for the name of the identity to use, related to the API key you want to connect with.

Adding the **--paper-mode** argument create a paper-trader instance in place of a connector to a real account.
Initial amounts of margin or quantity of assets must be configured into the profile.

At this time the slippage is not simulated. Orders are executed at bid/ask price according to the direction.
The order book is not used to look for the real offered quantities, then order are filled in one trade 
and without slippage.

A randomly chosen slippage factor could be implemented.

In paper-mode OHLCs and tick/trade data are stored to the database like in a normal live mode if the arguments
**--store-ohlc** or **--store-trade** are specified.

[More information about the paper-mode.](doc/papermode/index.md)

Live-mode
---------

Trading with live data using your real or demo trading account.

Example :

```
python siis.py real --profile=bitmex-xbteth1
```

Trades will be executed on your trading account on a real account.

I'll suggest you in a first time to test with a demo account or a testnet before to try with real account,
or try with very small amount.

Then, once you are ok with your strategy, with the interface, the stability, in a second time try with small amount,
on real account, finally let the bot playing with bigger amount. Please read the disclaimer at the bottom of this file.

By default, the stream of OHLCs are not stored to the database, you can add the **--store-ohlc** argument to save them.

By default, the stream of trades/ticks are not stored to the database, you can add the **--store-trade** argument to save them.

The strategy at startup will load, from the exchange, the necessary history of OHLC data.
That OHLCs, loaded at the startup of the strategy are stored into the database.

Interaction / CLI
-----------------

SiiS offers a basic but auto sufficient set of commands and keyboard shortcuts to manage and control your trades,
monitor your account, markets, tickers, trades, orders, positions, alerts and strategy performance.

In addition, there is a charting feature using matplotlib, only for debug purpose, that will be removed once the
charting feature of the Web-Trader will be completed.

During the execution of the program you can type a command starting by a colon key : followed by the name of the command.
Let's first type the **:help** command. To exit the command is quit, then type : followed by quit and then press enter.

There is some direct keys, not using the colon key, in default mode, and more specifics commands in command mode.

The **:help** command give you the list of shortcuts and commands, and **:help \<command-name\>** give the detailed help
for a specific command.

[More information about the command line interface, the different views and how to interact with.](doc/cli.md)

Web trader / Web Application
----------------------------

[SiiS is provided with a user-friendly Web Trader.](doc/webtrader/index.md)

About data storage
------------------

[Information about the structure and organisation of the data.](doc/organisation/dataset.md)

Note about performance, stability and scalability
-------------------------------------------------

SiiS uses distinct threads per watcher, per WebSocket, per trader, per strategy, plus a pool of workers for the strategies traders,
and potentially some others threads for notification and communication extra services.

Because of the Python GIL, threads are efficients when used for the IO operations, but not for the computing.

Performance seems good, tested with 100+ traded markets at trades/ticks level of watching.
It could be interesting to use the asyncio capacities to distribute the computing, but in cost of extra communication, and an additional latency.

Because you can execute many instances of SiiS, you can split your strategy into different instances. 

For example, you trade pairs on USDT, but you distinct 4 sorts ok markets, serious coin, alt coin, shit-coin and low volume shit-coins.
Then you could have 4 distinct profiles and then 4 instances of SiiS.

Another example, an exchange offers trading on spot and some others pairs on margin, then you will start two different instances.

Finally, you could set up your different VPS, one instance per VPS, for lesser failures, lower resource usage, 
and you could adjust the hardware to the optimal point to minimize costs.
